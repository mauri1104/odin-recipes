        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yeast</strong>: 2 1/4 teaspoons</li>
                <li><strong>All purpose unbleached white flour</strong>: 1 standard sized bag</li>
                <li><strong>Water</strong>: 1 1/3 cups of warm water</li>
                <li><strong>Extra virgin oil</strong>: 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>: 1 tablespoon</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: 1 tablespoon</li>
                <li><strong>Cornmeal</strong>: A good sprinkle</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all the Ingredients by hand or a mixer whichever you prefer.</li>
                <li>Knead by hand or by mixer. Personally I prefer by hand.</li>
                <li>Place your dough into mixing bowl, cover tightly and set aside for about 90 minutes or into a refrigerator overnight.</li>
                <li>Punch the dough down to release the possible air bubbles that have formed. Split into however much dough you need for your prefered size.</li>
                <li>Cover it with all your favorite toppings.</li>
                <li>Bake pizza at about 450 degrees for about 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
